**Delta Ranking Justification:** The major sections are ordered by perceived delta (potential impact/significance) for practical application and systemic understanding within an intentional community setting, prioritizing themes with the most immediate and foundational effect on group functioning ([[Influence Dynamics]], [[Cohesion Factors]], [[Communication Structures & Practices]]) before addressing structural and normative frameworks ([[Governance & Decision Making]], [[Values & Expectation Alignment]], [[Ethical Considerations]]). This prioritizes actionable knowledge for navigating and improving community dynamics, maximizing relevance for applied understanding.

## Ⅰ. INFLUENCE DYNAMICS

✴︎ **Principle:** Influence, the capacity to affect others' attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, is an inherent and continuously operating force within any social group, shaping interactions, decisions, and outcomes.

▷ **Understanding Influence Sources:** Recognize the diverse bases of [[Power]] operating within the community.

	▹ **Formal Power:** Derived from designated roles or positions (e.g., facilitator, treasurer). Often explicit but potentially limited in scope.

	▹ **Informal Power:** Arises organically from personal attributes or relationships.

		‧ **Expert Power:** Based on perceived knowledge or skills relevant to the community's goals or needs.

		‧ **Referent Power:** Stemming from charisma, likeability, respect, and [[Trust]]. Highly potent in small, relationally-dense groups.

		‧ **Information Power:** Control over the flow or access to critical information. Linked to [[Communication]] channels.

		‧ **Connection Power:** Derived from relationships with influential individuals inside or outside the group.

		‧ **Resource Power:** [[Control]] over tangible (e.g., space, funds) or intangible (e.g., time, social capital) resources valued by the community.

    > [!NOTE] Interplay of Power Bases
    > Individuals typically wield a combination of power sources. The effectiveness of influence attempts often depends on aligning the tactic with the relevant power base and the target's motivations.

▷ **Common Influence Tactics:** Analyze the methods used to exert influence.

	▹ **Rational Persuasion:** Using logical arguments and factual evidence. Effective when [[Trust]] and expertise are present.

	▹ **Inspirational Appeals:** Appealing to values, ideals, and aspirations. Connects to shared [[Values]] and community vision. Potent for mobilization.

	▹ **Consultation:** Involving others in planning and decision-making. Increases buy-in and utilizes collective intelligence. Linked to participatory [[Governance]].

	▹ **Ingratiation:** Using praise or favors to create goodwill before making a request. Can be perceived as manipulative if insincere.

	▹ **Personal Appeals:** Appealing to friendship or loyalty. Relies on strong interpersonal bonds (Referent Power).

	▹ **Exchange:** Offering something in return for compliance (explicit or implicit quid pro quo). Relates to [[Resource Management]].

	▹ **Coalition Building:** Mobilizing support from others to persuade a target. A key element of group [[Politics]].

	▹ **Legitimating Tactics:** Appealing to authority, rules, or policies. Relies on accepted [[Governance]] structures.

	▹ **Pressure Tactics:** Using demands, threats, or persistent reminders. ▼ Often generates resistance and damages [[Cohesion]].

    > [!WARNING] Destructive Influence Patterns
    > Chronic use of pressure tactics, manipulative ingratiation, or forming exclusionary coalitions can severely undermine trust and group cohesion, leading to [[Conflict]] and potential fragmentation.

▷ **Navigating Group [[Politics]]:** Acknowledge and manage the political landscape inherent in collective life.

	▹ ✴︎ **Politics as Negotiation:** View politics not just negatively, but as the ongoing process of negotiating interests, values, and resources within the group.

	▹ **Identifying Agendas:** Be aware of both stated and potential hidden agendas influencing behavior. Requires careful observation and critical thinking.

	▹ **Coalition Dynamics:** Understand how subgroups form and shift based on issues and relationships. ⇆ Alliances can be fluid.

	▹ ☝︎ **Promoting Transparency:** Encourage open discussion about differing interests and perspectives to make political maneuvering more explicit and less detrimental. Requires robust [[Communication]] norms.

▷ **Impact on [[Cohesion]]:** Influence dynamics directly shape the quality of relationships and group unity.

	▹ **Constructive Influence:** Builds trust, fosters collaboration, aligns actions with shared goals. Uses tactics like consultation, rational persuasion, inspirational appeals ethically.

	▹ **Destructive Influence:** Creates resentment, division, cynicism. Relies on manipulation, coercion, self-serving politics. ▼ Directly harms cohesion.

▷ **[[Ethics]] of Influence:** Consider the moral dimension of influencing others.

	▹ **Manipulation vs. Persuasion:** Differentiate between transparent attempts to persuade based on merit/shared values versus deceptive or coercive methods. [[Transparency]] is key.

	▹ **Intent:** Examine the underlying motivation – is it for personal gain at others' expense, or for perceived collective benefit?

	▹ ☝︎ **Ethical Guideline:** Strive for influence that respects autonomy, promotes mutual understanding, and aligns with explicitly agreed-upon community [[Values]].

> [!TIP] Enhancing Positive Influence
> Focus on building referent and expert power through genuine contribution, reliability, and demonstrated integrity. Utilize consultative and inspirational approaches grounded in shared values.

## Ⅱ. COHESION FACTORS

✴︎ **Principle:** [[Cohesion]], the degree to which members are attracted to each other and motivated to stay in the group, is critical for the resilience, satisfaction, and long-term viability of an intentional community.

▷ **Drivers of Cohesion:** Identify factors that strengthen group bonds.

	▹ **Shared [[Values]] and Vision:** ⇆ A clear, compelling, and genuinely shared purpose and set of guiding principles provides fundamental alignment. Requires ongoing reinforcement.

	▹ **Mutual [[Trust]]:** The belief in the reliability, integrity, and benevolent intentions of other members. Built incrementally through consistent, trustworthy behavior. Foundational.

	▹ **Positive Interpersonal Relationships:** Feelings of liking, respect, and mutual support among members. Social activities and shared experiences contribute.

	▹ **Perceived Group Success:** Achieving collective goals enhances group pride and reinforces the value of membership. Requires clear goals and celebrating milestones.

	▹ **Effective [[Communication]]:** Open, honest, and empathetic communication allows members to understand each other, resolve [[Conflict]], and coordinate effectively.

	▹ **Clear Group Boundaries:** Differentiating the group from the external environment can strengthen internal identity, but ▼ excessive closure can lead to insularity.

	▹ **Equitable Contribution & Recognition:** Members feeling that workloads and benefits are distributed fairly, and contributions are acknowledged. Linked to [[Fairness]] and [[Resource Management]].

    > [!ABSTRACT] First Principle of Belonging
    > Humans have a fundamental need to belong. Cohesion arises when a group effectively meets members' needs for connection, identity, security, and purpose.

▷ **Threats to Cohesion:** Recognize factors that weaken group bonds.

	▹ **Unresolved [[Conflict]]:** Persistent disagreements, especially when handled destructively, create factions and erode trust.

	▹ **[[Power]] Imbalances & Cliques:** Perceived unfairness in influence or the formation of exclusionary subgroups undermines group unity. Linked to [[Politics]].

	▹ **Unmet or Conflicting [[Expectations]]:** Discrepancies between what members expect and the reality of community life lead to disappointment and friction. Requires proactive [[Expectation Management]].

	▹ **Poor [[Communication]]:** Misunderstandings, lack of [[Transparency]], inadequate [[Feedback]] loops breed suspicion and prevent problems from being addressed. ▼ Critical failure point.

	▹ **Lack of [[Accountability]]:** Failure to address behaviors that violate group norms or values signals that the 'rules' don't matter, damaging trust in the system. Linked to [[Governance]].

	▹ **Resource Scarcity/Conflict:** Disputes over limited resources (time, money, space) can strain relationships if not managed fairly. Linked to [[Resource Management]].

	▹ **Value Drift:** Gradual divergence in core values or interpretations without explicit renegotiation.

    > [!DANGER] Cohesion Breakdown Spiral
    > Low cohesion can lead to reduced participation, increased conflict avoidance or escalation, member withdrawal (psychological or physical), and ultimately, group dissolution. This process can accelerate rapidly once trust is significantly breached.

▷ **Building and Maintaining [[Trust]]:** Trust is the bedrock of cohesion.

	▹ **Consistency & Reliability:** Do what you say you will do. Follow through on commitments.

	▹ **[[Transparency]] & Openness:** Share information relevant to others, be open about intentions and decision-making processes where appropriate.

	▹ **Vulnerability & Authenticity:** Sharing appropriately personal information or admitting mistakes can foster connection, but requires psychological safety.

	▹ **Demonstrating Care & Competence:** Show genuine concern for others' well-being and demonstrate competence in areas of responsibility.

	▹ ☝︎ **Active Trust Repair:** When trust is damaged, address it directly, acknowledge harm, and take concrete steps to rebuild. Avoidance is corrosive.

> [!CHECK] Cohesion Health Check
> Regularly assess group cohesion through informal observation (e.g., energy levels, interaction patterns, conflict frequency/style) or structured reflection. Are members engaged? Is trust palpable? Are conflicts being addressed constructively?

## Ⅲ. COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES & PRACTICES

✴︎ **Principle:** The effectiveness and health of an intentional community are fundamentally dependent on the quality, clarity, and appropriateness of its [[Communication]] structures and practices.

▷ **Communication Channels:** Evaluate the mix of formal and informal channels.

	▹ **Formal Channels:** Scheduled meetings (whole group, committees), official documents (minutes, agreements), designated roles for communication. Provide structure and record.

	▹ **Informal Channels:** Spontaneous conversations, social gatherings, shared online chats. Crucial for relationship building and rapid information sharing, but ▼ prone to gossip/misinformation if not balanced with formal channels.

	▹ **Digital Platforms:** Email lists, messaging apps, shared drives. Efficient for dissemination and asynchronous communication, but require clear norms for use (e.g., response times, appropriate topics). ⇆ Can exclude less tech-savvy members if relied upon exclusively.

    > [!NOTE] Channel Appropriateness
    > Match the communication channel to the message's purpose and sensitivity. Complex or conflictual topics often require richer, synchronous channels (e.g., face-to-face meetings) rather than lean, asynchronous ones (e.g., email).

▷ **[[Feedback]] Loops:** Implement mechanisms for constructive exchange.

	▹ ✴︎ **Necessity of Feedback:** Regular, skillful feedback is essential for learning, adaptation, course correction, and preventing the buildup of resentment.

	▹ **Formal Feedback:** Performance reviews (if applicable), project debriefs, dedicated feedback sessions within meetings.

	▹ **Informal Feedback:** Encouraging members to offer timely, specific, and constructive feedback to each other as part of the daily culture.

	▹ **Skillful Feedback Delivery:** Focus on behavior, not personality. Use "I" statements. Be specific and timely. Check for understanding. Consider models like Nonviolent Communication (NVC).

	▹ **Receiving Feedback:** Cultivate openness and non-defensiveness. Listen to understand. Ask clarifying questions. Separate feedback from self-worth.

    > [!DANGER] Lack of Functional Feedback
    > Without effective feedback loops, misunderstandings fester, poor performance or problematic behavior persists, learning is stifled, and [[Trust]] erodes. This is a major contributor to community dysfunction.

▷ **[[Transparency]] in Communication:** Foster openness in information sharing.

	▹ **Access to Information:** Ensure members have access to information relevant to their participation and decisions affecting them (e.g., financial summaries, meeting minutes, decision rationales).

	▹ **Clarity of Processes:** Make [[Governance]] and decision-making processes clear and understandable. Why was a decision made? Who was involved?

	▹ ▼ **Limits to Transparency:** Balance transparency with needs for confidentiality (personal issues) and avoiding information overload. Define boundaries clearly.

▷ **Core Communication Skills:** Emphasize foundational interpersonal skills.

	▹ **Active Listening:** Fully concentrating on, understanding, responding to, and remembering what is being said. Involves verbal and non-verbal cues. More than just waiting to talk.

	▹ **Empathy:** Understanding and sharing the feelings of another. Crucial for navigating disagreements and building [[Cohesion]].

	▹ **Clarity & Conciseness:** Expressing oneself clearly and directly, avoiding jargon or ambiguity.

	▹ **Nonviolent Communication (NVC):** A framework focusing on observations, feelings, needs, and requests to promote understanding and compassionate connection, especially during [[Conflict]].

    > [!TIP] Cultivate a Communication Culture
    > Explicitly discuss and agree upon communication norms. Provide opportunities for members to practice and improve communication skills (e.g., workshops, facilitated discussions). Model desired behaviors.

▷ **[[Conflict]] Resolution Communication:** Equip the group with tools for difficult conversations.

	▹ **Structured Dialogue:** Utilize formats (e.g., mediation principles, talking circles) that ensure everyone is heard and focus discussion on underlying needs and interests.

	▹ **Focus on Issues, Not People:** Depersonalize conflict by concentrating on the problem to be solved, not on blaming individuals.

	▹ **Identify Underlying Needs:** Look beyond stated positions to uncover the core needs or values driving the conflict. Finding solutions that meet multiple needs is key.

> [!CHECK] Communication Audit
> Periodically review: Are meetings effective? Is information flowing adequately? Is feedback occurring constructively? Are conflicts being addressed or avoided? Where are the bottlenecks or pain points?

## Ⅳ. GOVERNANCE & DECISION MAKING

✴︎ **Principle:** [[Governance]] structures and decision-making processes define how [[Power]] is formally distributed, how collective choices are made, and how [[Accountability]] is maintained, significantly impacting efficiency, [[Fairness]], and [[Cohesion]].

▷ **Governance Models:** BALLOT_BOX Select or adapt a model appropriate for the group's size, purpose, and values.

	▹ **Consensus:** Aims for agreement from all members. Fosters buy-in and utilizes collective wisdom, but ▼ can be slow and prone to blocking by individuals or 'tyranny of the minority'. Requires high [[Trust]] and communication skills.

	▹ **Sociocracy/Holacracy:** Distributes authority into linked circles/roles, uses consent-based decision-making (no reasoned objections, rather than full agreement). Aims for efficiency and empowerment within defined domains. Requires training and commitment.

	▹ **Majority Rule:** Faster for decisions, but ▼ can alienate minorities and lead to polarization if used for significant issues without adequate deliberation.

	▹ **Hierarchical/Delegated Authority:** Certain individuals or subgroups are empowered to make specific decisions. Efficient for defined tasks, but requires clear mandates and [[Accountability]].

	▹ **Ad-hoc/Informal:** Decisions made organically as needed. Can work in very small, high-trust groups with shared [[Values]], but ▼ risks inconsistency, lack of [[Transparency]], and [[Power]] concentration based on initiative or assertiveness.

    > [!INFO] Model Hybridization
    > Many communities blend elements of different models (e.g., consensus for core values/vision, delegated authority for operational tasks). The key is clarity and explicit agreement on *which* process applies *when*.

▷ **Decision-Making Clarity:** Ensure processes are well-defined and understood.

	▹ **Scope of Authority:** Who has the authority to make which decisions? (Individual roles, committees, whole group).

	▹ **Process Steps:** What are the steps for bringing forward a proposal, discussing it, and reaching a decision?

	▹ **Information Requirements:** What information is needed for informed decisions? How is it gathered and shared? Linked to [[Communication]].

	▹ ☝︎ **Document Processes:** Clearly document agreed-upon governance and decision-making procedures for reference and onboarding new members.

▷ **[[Accountability]] Mechanisms:** Establish ways to ensure responsibilities are met and norms are upheld.

	▹ **Role Clarity:** Clear [[Expectations]] for roles and responsibilities.

	▹ **Review Processes:** Regular reviews of decisions, projects, or role performance (can be peer-based or structured). Linked to [[Feedback]].

	▹ **[[Conflict]] Resolution Pathways:** Defined steps for addressing grievances or breaches of agreements.

	▹ **Consequences/Restorative Practices:** Agreed-upon responses for failing to meet responsibilities or violating core [[Values]]/norms, ideally focusing on restoration and learning rather than solely punishment. Requires [[Ethical]] considerations.

    > [!WARNING] Accountability Gaps
    > Lack of clear accountability mechanisms allows dysfunction to persist, erodes trust in the system, and can lead to burnout among those who compensate for others' unmet responsibilities.

▷ **[[Resource Management]] Integration:** Link governance to the allocation of shared resources.

	▹ **Budgeting & Financial Oversight:** Transparent processes for managing collective funds.

	▹ **Labor & Contribution Systems:** Fair ways to track and value different types of contributions (time, skills, money).

	▹ **Space & Asset Allocation:** Clear procedures for using shared spaces or equipment.

	▹ ✴︎ **Resource Decisions as Power:** Decisions about resources are inherently political and impact [[Influence]] dynamics. Ensure processes are perceived as fair.

> [!QUESTION] Governance Fitness
> Does the current governance system enable timely and effective decision-making while maintaining member buy-in and trust? Does it align with the community's stated values? Where are the friction points?

## Ⅴ. VALUES & EXPECTATION ALIGNMENT

✴︎ **Principle:** Explicitly defining and aligning shared [[Values]] and managing member [[Expectations]] are crucial for fostering [[Cohesion]], preventing [[Conflict]], and creating a predictable and mutually understood social environment.

▷ **Defining Core [[Values]]:** Make the implicit explicit.

	▹ **Articulation Process:** Engage the group in identifying and articulating the core values that underpin the community's purpose and desired culture (e.g., sustainability, cooperation, personal growth, [[Transparency]]).

	▹ **Behavioral Anchors:** Translate abstract values into concrete, observable behaviors. What does "respect" or "collaboration" look like *in practice* here?

	▹ **Living Documents:** Regularly revisit and potentially refine values statements as the group evolves. ⇆ Values can shift over time.

    > [!ABSTRACT] Values as Navigational Aids
    > Shared values serve as a compass for decision-making, conflict resolution, and evaluating behaviors, providing a common ground for navigating complexity.

▷ **[[Onboarding]] & Socialization:** Integrate new members effectively.

	▹ **Explicit Communication:** Clearly communicate core values, norms, [[Expectations]], and [[Governance]] structures during the onboarding process. Don't assume newcomers will just "pick it up."

	▹ **Mentorship/Buddy Systems:** Pairing new members with experienced ones can facilitate social integration and transmission of tacit knowledge and culture.

	▹ **Probationary Periods (Optional):** Some communities use a trial period to ensure mutual fit regarding values and expectations before full membership. Requires clear criteria and [[Feedback]].

▷ **Role Clarity & Contribution [[Expectations]]:** Define what is expected of members.

	▹ **Responsibilities:** Clearly outline the expected contributions (time, tasks, financial) associated with membership or specific roles.

	▹ **Flexibility & Adaptation:** Acknowledge that individual capacity and circumstances change. Have processes for renegotiating roles and contributions.

	▹ **Valuing Diverse Contributions:** Recognize and value different forms of contribution beyond the easily quantifiable (e.g., emotional labor, relationship building). Linked to [[Fairness]].

▷ **Managing Divergence & [[Conflict]]:** Address misalignments proactively.

	▹ **Regular Check-ins:** Create opportunities for members to discuss their experiences and whether reality aligns with their expectations.

	▹ **Surfacing Assumptions:** Encourage members to voice their underlying assumptions and expectations rather than letting them remain unspoken potential sources of conflict. Requires psychological safety fostered by [[Trust]] and good [[Communication]].

	▹ **Negotiation Space:** Frame expectation gaps not as failures, but as opportunities for renegotiation and finding mutually agreeable adjustments.

▷ **The [[Psychological Contract]]:** Understand unspoken beliefs.

	▹ **Definition:** An individual's implicit beliefs about the mutual obligations between themselves and the community. What do they expect to give, and what do they expect to receive?

	▹ **Formation:** Shaped by initial communications, observed behaviors, and personal assumptions.

	▹ ▼ **Breach Impact:** Violations of the psychological contract (perceived unfairness, unmet promises) can lead to significant drops in motivation, trust, and commitment, often more intensely than breaches of formal agreements.

    > [!DANGER] Implicit Expectation Traps
    > Relying solely on implicit understanding of values and expectations is high-risk. Unspoken assumptions inevitably diverge, leading to misunderstandings, resentment, and conflict. Explicit articulation and regular checks are preventative maintenance.

> [!TIP] Expectation Setting as Continuous Process
> View expectation management not as a one-time event during onboarding, but as an ongoing dialogue integrated into regular community life (e.g., meetings, reviews, informal check-ins).

## Ⅵ. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

✴︎ **Principle:** [[Ethics]] provide the normative framework guiding the use of [[Influence]], the design of [[Governance]], and the nature of interpersonal interactions, ensuring [[Fairness]], [[Accountability]], and respect for individuals within the community.

▷ **Fundamental Ethical Principles:** Establish a shared ethical foundation.

	▹ **[[Transparency]] & Honesty:** Being truthful in communications and open about processes and decisions where appropriate. Builds [[Trust]].

	▹ **[[Fairness]] & Equity:** Striving for impartiality and justice in processes (procedural fairness) and outcomes (distributive fairness). Considering diverse needs and contributions.

	▹ **Respect for Autonomy:** Recognizing individuals' rights to self-determination and differing opinions, within the bounds of community agreements.

	▹ **Confidentiality & Privacy:** Respecting personal information shared in confidence and establishing clear boundaries around privacy within the community context.

	▹ **Non-Maleficence & Beneficence:** Avoiding harm (physical, emotional, relational) and acting in ways that promote the well-being of members and the community.

	▹ **[[Accountability]]:** Taking responsibility for one's actions and their impact on others; upholding community agreements.

    > [!NOTE] Contextual Ethics
    > While universal principles apply, their specific application needs to be interpreted and agreed upon within the unique context and [[Values]] of the intentional community.

▷ **[[Power]] Dynamics & [[Ethics]]:** Address the ethical responsibilities associated with influence.

	▹ ✴︎ **Power Holder Responsibility:** Those with more formal or informal [[Power]] have a greater ethical responsibility to use it judiciously, transparently, and for the benefit of the group, not just personal gain.

	▹ **Avoiding Coercion & Manipulation:** Distinguishing ethical persuasion from tactics that undermine autonomy or exploit vulnerabilities. Linked to [[Influence Dynamics]].

	▹ **Promoting Voice:** Ensuring that less powerful members feel safe and empowered to voice concerns or dissent without fear of retribution. Linked to [[Communication]] and [[Governance]].

▷ **Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks:** BALLOT_BOX Provide tools for navigating ethical dilemmas.

	▹ **Values Check:** Does the proposed action align with the community's core [[Values]]?

	▹ **Stakeholder Analysis:** Who is affected by this decision, and how? Have their perspectives been considered?

	▹ **Transparency Test:** Would we be comfortable with this decision being public knowledge within the community?

	▹ **Universality Test:** Would we want this principle applied in all similar situations?

    > [!WARNING] Ethical Blind Spots & Rationalization
    > Groups can develop collective blind spots or rationalize unethical behavior, especially under pressure or when strong [[Cohesion]] discourages dissent ('groupthink'). Actively encouraging diverse perspectives and critical reflection is crucial.

▷ **Addressing Unethical Behavior:** Establish clear and fair processes.

	▹ **Reporting Mechanisms:** Safe and confidential ways for members to raise ethical concerns.

	▹ **Investigation Process:** Fair and impartial procedures for looking into allegations.

	▹ **Restorative Justice Principles:** Where possible, focus on understanding harm, taking responsibility, and repairing relationships, rather than purely punitive measures. Requires skilled facilitation.

	▹ **Clear Consequences:** Agreed-upon consequences for breaches of ethical conduct, aligned with community values and [[Governance]].

> [!CHECK] Ethical Climate Assessment
> Periodically reflect: Do members feel treated fairly? Is power used responsibly? Is there trust in the integrity of processes and individuals? Are ethical concerns openly discussed?

> [!TIP] Ethical Leadership is Key
> Individuals in positions of formal or informal leadership play a crucial role in setting the ethical tone through their own behavior and by actively promoting ethical awareness and discussion within the group.

## GROUNDING RESOURCES APPENDIX

**Methodology:** Performed web searches for best practices and foundational concepts related to key themes (e.g., "Nonviolent Communication principles," "Sociocracy decision making," "building trust in small groups," "psychological contract intentional communities"). Prioritized reputable sources like established organizations, academic summaries, and recognized practitioners.

1.  **Rosenberg, M. B. (2015). *Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life* (3rd ed.). PuddleDancer Press.**
	*   **Summary:** This book provides the foundational framework for Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a communication process emphasizing observation without evaluation, identifying feelings, connecting feelings to underlying needs, and making clear requests. It offers practical techniques directly applicable to improving interpersonal communication, feedback delivery, and conflict resolution within intentional communities by fostering empathy and mutual understanding. The principles align with enhancing [[Communication]] effectiveness and managing [[Conflict]] constructively.
	*   **Source Type:** Foundational Text by originator of the model.
	*   **Relevance:** Core practice for [[Communication Structures & Practices]] and [[Conflict]] Resolution.

2.  **Buck, J. A., & Endenburg, G. (2012). *Sociocracy and Consent*. The Sociocracy Group.** (Note: While a single definitive APA source is tricky, multiple resources explain the core concept consistently. A representative summary follows based on common descriptions from sources like sociocracyforall.org and sociocracy.info).
	*   **Summary:** Sociocracy (or Dynamic Governance) provides a governance system based on consent-based decision-making within linked circles (teams). Decisions are made when there are no "paramount objections" based on reasoned arguments against a proposal's feasibility within a defined domain. It emphasizes equivalence in decision-making (not necessarily equality in all matters) and continuous improvement through feedback loops. This offers a concrete alternative to pure consensus or majority rule, relevant to [[Governance & Decision Making]] by distributing [[Power]] and aiming for both efficiency and buy-in.
	*   **Source Type:** Organizational resources / Practitioners explaining the model.
	*   **Relevance:** Concrete model applicable to [[Governance & Decision Making]], [[Power]] distribution, and [[Accountability]].
